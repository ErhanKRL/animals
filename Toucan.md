___
* Toucans are Neotropical members of the near passerine bird family Ramphastidae. They are brightly marked and have large, often colorful bills.

* Toucans are arboreal and typically lay two to four white eggs in their nests. They make their nests in tree hollows and holes excavated by other animals such as woodpeckersâ€”the toucan bill has very limited use as an excavation tool.
* Toucans are resident breeders and do not migrate. They are usually found in pairs or small flocks.
